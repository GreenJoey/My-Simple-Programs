#My Simple Android Apps

This folder contains all the Android App that I wrote while I am doing my Android Development course.
All the folder can be pulled and directly opened as a project in Android Studio.

#<a href="https://github.com/GreenJoey/My-Simple-Programs/tree/master/Java/Android/HelloWorld">Hello-World</a>

This project is the first android app that wrote

What it does:
<ul>
<li>Opens Up and greets you with a Hello World</li>
<li>Has a text feild where you can input your name</li>
<li>Has a button which on clicking will change the Hello World text to Hello "Your Name"</li> 
<li>And display a toast in the center of the screen with the same message</li>
