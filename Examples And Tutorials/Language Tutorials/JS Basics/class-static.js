/**
 * Static methods are methods relevant to all instances of a class â€” not
 * just any one instance. These methods receive information from their
 * arguments and not a class instance, which allows us to invoke a class'
 * static methods without creating an instance of the class. In fact, we
 * actually can't call a static method on an instantiated class object
 * (attempting to do so throws a TypeError).
 *
 * We define a class' static methods using the static keyword. 
 * We typically use these methods to create utility functions for
 * applications, as they can't be called on class objects.
