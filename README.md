# My Simple Programs
This _**`repo`**_ holds almost _**`all the programs`**_ I wrote for myself since I had my laptop

#<a href="alias.md">The aliases I use</a>
To use these alias you can put copy the alias in your _**`.bashrc`**_ file and then use the command `source .bashrc` to load the aliases
Don't just copy all the aliases. Copy those you need
