## Next Password
This level introduced us that some websites block right-clicking as a Pseudo-Security measure XD. The password can easily be found by using _CTRL+U_ to open the source code of the page.
Though if we right-click outside the white zone on the page, we can see that we can actually get the menu to open source :P
